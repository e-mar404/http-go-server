# http-go-server
implementing http with go

## Tests

- [ ] If TCPServer successfully binds to a port it outputs to stdout "Listening on port: <port>"
- [ ] If TCPServer fails to bind to port it outputs an error "Unable to bind to port: <port>"

## Notes:

- [ ] need to break up stuff and try to follow srp
- [ ] will need to look into how to mock a function for net.Listen

## What do I want to acheive with this?

I want to be able to make http work and not just understand how it works. 

Writing this in go (which ive never used before) in order to learn the language, I am wanting to try this new way of learning by fully diving in. 

I am deciding to use go because after doing a full stack project for my databases class I noticed myself enjoying the backend + db part of the project a lot more that doing the frontend. Researching a bit more about backend stuff I found out that go is starting to be used in the serverside a lot more now. At some point I'll be trying to do something with concurrency in go since ive read that go is well liked for this, which makes sense for how big go is in the backend space.
